How to prepare for machine learning questions during job interviews
-----

For every machine learning technique on your resume or mentioned in the job post, you should be able to do the following without referencing external resources:

- Describe it to a nontechnical person. Have a metaphor and an applied business example.
- Explain it on a whiteboard.
- For every algorithm, write the formula for the loss function.
- Call the function with the most common package.
- Code it from scratch in pure Python.
- For every algorithm, describe the parameters and hyperparameters.
- List how to maximize the fit to training data (minimize bias). List how to minimize overfitting to the training data (minimize variance).
- When to use it and not use it.
- Advantages and disadvantages relative to other techniques.

(This list comes directly from MSDS alumnus.)
