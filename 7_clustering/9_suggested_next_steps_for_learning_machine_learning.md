What should I do next?
---------

- Complete additional machine learning projects 
    - They should be public on GitHub.
    - The highest value projects are individual, custom, novel, applied, domain-specific problems, potentially high-value business impact, end-to-end, and contemporary.
    
- Continue learning
    - Create a portfolio (75% fundamentals / 20% contemporary best practices / 5% stretch / cutting-edge)
    - IMHO - [Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) (2021) is currently the best book on machine learning.
    
- Practice for job interviewing 
    - Job interviews are oral exams without notes. You should be able to fluently discussion machine learning at the appropriate level of detail.
    - Use my [machine learning interview study guide](https://github.com/brianspiering/ml_lab/blob/main/resources/machine_learning_job_interview_prep.md). Fill out the table!
